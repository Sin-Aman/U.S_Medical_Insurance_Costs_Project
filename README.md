# U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Data Analysis Portfolio Project
Welcome to my Insurance Costs Data Analysis portfolio project! In this project, I explore and analyze an insurance dataset using Python on a Jupyter Notebook file. This project showcases my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Overview
In this project, I perform the following tasks:
1. **Data Loading:** Load insurance data from a CSV file.
2. **Data Analysis:** Analyze various attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges.
3. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including histograms, bar charts, and descriptive statistics.
4. **BMI Categorization:** Categorize individuals based on their BMI (Body Mass Index) into underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese categories.
5. **Average Age Calculation:** Calculate the average age of the individuals in the dataset.
6. **Gender Analysis:** Count the number of males and females in the dataset.
7. **Region Analysis:** Identify unique regions from where the individuals come.
8. **Average Charges Calculation:** Calculate the average yearly medical insurance charges for the individuals.
   
## Getting Started
To run the project, you need:\
Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine
1. **Getting Started**\
Clone the Repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/Sin-Aman/U.S_Medical_Insurance_Costs_Project.git`
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook file:**\
`jupyter notebook U.S_Medical_Insurance_Costs_Project.ipynb`

## **Results**
The project provides valuable insights into the insurance dataset, including age distribution, BMI categorization, gender analysis, region details, and average insurance charges.
